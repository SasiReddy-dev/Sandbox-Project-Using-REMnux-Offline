# Sandbox Project Using REMnux (Offline)

This project was developed as part of an internship at **NFC (Nuclear Fuel Complex)**.  
It demonstrates a secure sandbox environment built using **REMnux** and designed to operate **completely offline** â€” ideal for malware and file behavior analysis in a controlled environment.

## ðŸ§  Overview
The sandbox system performs both **Static** and **Dynamic** analysis of uploaded files.  
It supports execution in **Windows (host)** and **REMnux VM (guest)** environments, allowing safe inspection of potentially malicious samples.

## âœ¨ Features
- Upload and analyze files securely through a web interface  
- Perform both **Static** and **Dynamic** malware analysis  
- Generate detailed **Excel reports** summarizing findings  
- Works **fully offline** (no internet connection required)  
- Compatible with both **Windows** and **VMware/REMnux** setups  
- Clean, modular backend structure using Flask  
- Supports exporting results for further manual inspection
